# RC-Helper
By - Mohammed Aljubori

This is an Android app that I made using Android Studio (I only uploaded the Java code I wrote not the entire enviornement). This app is meant to be helpful for everyday uses in the Remote Control (RC) field for hobbyists to use. 


## Storyboard
The storyboard shows a simple idea of all of the usecases that are added to the app. <br>
